Title: Real Time Bus Tracker from MIT to Harvard

Description: This project was working with DOM in JavaScript. We created a Mapbox account to get the access token and used it to complete the coding attributes and
started the marker animation on the map to show stops between MIT and Harvard. Finally code worked and could able to see a marker was moving from one bus stop to the next on the map with specific time interval.

How to run the road map:
In this activity, we will be using the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then, we need to and add an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.
First of all, add your code to the mapanimation.js file.
To accomplish this task, need to do the following activities:
•	Create a Mapbox account and get the access token
•	Add the access token to the mapboxgl instance defined in the mapanimation.js
•	Create a marker and add it to the map using the mapboxgl pre-built functions.
•	The function move() is called when the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" is selected. This is how marker animation get to start.
•	If code works, one should be able to see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.
